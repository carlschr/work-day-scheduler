# Work Day Scheduler

## About the Project
The goal of the project was to create an application that would allow the entry and storage of events into a schedule for the current work day.

## Guidelines
* The project must make use of the moment.js and jQuery.js libraries
* The current day must display at the top of the application
* The times in the schedule must be color-coded to indicate past, present, or future.
* The entered events must persist upon reloading the page
